# üöó Vehicle detection, Tracking, Number plate recognition, Speed calculation all on RaspberryPi B4 model. üçì

In this project, we used model developed by https://github.com/DoubangoTelecom/ultimateALPR-SDK
This repository contains model for Windowns, linux, android and Raspbian OS. The model is very fast and can be used for real time applications with some modifications.
OpenVINO enhances speed of processing, detection hence improves model's performance in moving environment.
